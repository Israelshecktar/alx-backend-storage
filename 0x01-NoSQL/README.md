NoSQL, as suggested by its name, is a non-structured query language that is not limited to table-based storage. It can accommodate various data types and is valued for its speed and scalability, particularly in comparison to SQL. This makes it especially suitable for applications that handle large volumes of data and require frequent and consistent data retrieval.
